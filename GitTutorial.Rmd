# Part One: Introduction and Installation

## 1. Introduction: Why Git and GitHub?
### What's the difference between Git and GitHub.
Git is a **version control system** that is like a supped up version of the "Track Changes" feature within Microsoft Word. Git allows the different collaborators on a project to track changes and revert to older versions if needed. 

GitHub is a cloud based platform built around Git that stores code *__pushed__* to it from a computer that uses Git.
