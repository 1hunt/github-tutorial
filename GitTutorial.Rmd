# Part One: Introduction and Installation 

## 1. Introduction: Why Git and GitHub?
### What's the difference between Git and GitHub.
Git is a **version control system** that is like a supped up version of the "Track Changes" feature within Microsoft Word. Git allows the different collaborators on a project to track changes and revert to older versions if needed. 

GitHub is a cloud based platform built around Git that stores code *__pushed__* to it from a computer that uses Git.


## 2. Register for a GitHub Account

If you do not currently have a GitHub account then you will register for one today! If you already have a GitHub account, sit back and relax while your classmates get set up.

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Pick a username that incorporates your actual name. Enter an email and create a password.
3. Select a plan: Free is all you will likely need.
4. (optional) Answer a few questions about your code skill level, plans for using GitHub, and lost some interests.
5. You'll get a verification email. 
6. When you click the link from the Verification you will be taken to your new GitHub account with the option to create your first repository or *repo*. Do not make one yet. We will come back to that. 

## 3. Upgrade R and RStudio
We all have R and RStudio on our own computers by now, but here you can check your version and upgrade if needed.

```{r version, echo=TRUE }
R.version.string
```

If you would like to update your current R packages you can use the following command:

```{r update, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
```

## 4. Install Git
Open up the terminal or shell and check to see if you already git installed.

```{bash}
which git
git --version
```

### 4.1 Windows Installation
There are two options for Windows installation:
**Option 1** : install Git for Windows (https://gitforwindows.org), aka _msysgit_ or "Git Bash", which will provide Git as well as a Bash shell.

_side note on shells/terminal/bash. Windows OS doesn't provide a shell terminal. Shell refers to an early (1970s) command-line interpreter for Unix shell.  Bash (**B**ourne **a**gain **sh**ell) is the command-line interpreter for GNU (**g**nu **n**ot **u**nix) OS. It's all still very confusing, just know that bash is largely compatible with shell, and that for many Git commands the "Git Bash" shell/terminal will need to be used._

### 4.2 macOS Installation

## 5. Bonjour Git, enchante

## 6. Optional: Install a Git client

## 9. Connect to GitHub 

###Make a repo

Here, we are just making sure we can push and pull and everyone is communicating.

1. Head to https://github.com/ and check that you're still logged in

2. Click on the green "New" button or click on "Repositories" on your profile page and then click on the "New" button. 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("new.png")
```

3. Fill in:

Repository name 

Description: something for the README file

Public (for now)

and then YES initilize the repo with a README

For everything else, select default.

4. Click "Create repository"

5. Copy the HTTP clone URL to your clipboard via green "Clone or Download" button

## 13. Detect Git from RStudio

1. Create repository from RSTudio/GitHub, see if it appears on GitHub/RStudio

2. Set global directory path to Git in RStudio
		a. >Tools >Global Options >Git/SVN
		b. Git executable:
			  i. Windows::C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe
			  ii. Mac::/usr/bin/git
        
## 14. RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell
 
1. Various debugging tips
 
## 15. New Project, GitHub first
 
1. Click green "create repository" button on GitHub home page
  a. Repository name
  b. public or private
  c. YES, create README
 
2. Connect to the new repo in RStudio
  a. File > New Project > Version Control > Git
  
  b. Repository URL: https://github.com/username/reponame
  
3. Stage, Commit, Push documents to GitHub
  a. Create/Load documents
  b. Stage documents by clicking check box next to their name in Git window in upper right of RStudio
  c. Commit by pressing "Commit" button in Git window
      i. opens new window
      ii. add commit message and click commit button
  d. Click green up arrow in Git window to push documents to GitHub
    
4. Pull a repository from GitHub by pressing the blue down arrow in the Git window
  i. access repository files in Files window in lower right of RStudio
  
## 22. Branching
1. Branches are separate lines of edits which enable multiple people to work at the same time without destroying each others work
2. The main branch is named ‘Master’ by default
3. To create new branch:
	a. Git Bash::$ git branch branch_name #create branch
	b. RStudio:: Button in GUI (see picture)
4. To switch between branches
	a. Git Bash::$ git checkout branch_name #create branch
    	b. RStudio:: Button in GUI (see picture)
5. To merge branches
    	a. Do this in Git Bash, not RStudio or GitHub:
        	$ git checkout master #switch to master branch
        	$ git merge branch_name #merge branch_name into master
    	b. Conflicts
        	i. if merging branch conflicts with main, CONFLICT message will show in Git Bash
        	ii. find out more about the conflict: Git Bash::$ git status
        	iii. resolve conflict: open file from the main branch in R, edit to meet desired outcome
6. Abandon merge: Git Bash::$ git merge --abort
