# Part One: Introduction and Installation 

## 1. Introduction: Why Git and GitHub?
### What's the difference between Git and GitHub.
Git is a **version control system** that is like a supped up version of the "Track Changes" feature within Microsoft Word. Git allows the different collaborators on a project to track changes and revert to older versions if needed. 

GitHub is a cloud based platform built around Git that stores code *__pushed__* to it from a computer that uses Git.


## 2. Register for a GitHub Account

If you do not currently have a GitHub account then you will register for one today! If you already have a GitHub account, sit back and relax while your classmates get set up.

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Pick a username that incorporates your actual name. Enter an email and create a password.
3. Select a plan: Free is all you will likely need.
4. (optional) Answer a few questions about your code skill level, plans for using GitHub, and lost some interests.
5. You'll get a verification email. 
6. When you click the link from the Verification you will be taken to your new GitHub account with the option to create your first repository or *repo*. Do not make one yet. We will come back to that. 

## 3. Upgrade R and RStudio
We all have R and RStudio on our own computers by now, but here you can check your version and upgrade if needed.

```{r version, echo=TRUE }
R.version.string
```

If you would like to update your current R packages you can use the following command:

```{r update, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
```

## 4. Install Git
Open up the terminal or shell and check to see if you already git installed.

```{bash}
which git
git --version
```

### 4.1 Windows Installation


### 4.2 macOS Installation

## 5. Bonjour Git, enchante

## 6. Optional: Install a Git client

## 9. Connect to GitHub 

###Make a repo

Here, we are just making sure we can push and pull and everyone is communicating.

1. Head to https://github.com/ and check that you're still logged in

2. Click on the green "New" button or click on "Repositories" on your profile page and then click on the "New" button. 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("new.png")
```

3. Fill in:

Repository name 

Description: something for the README file

Public (for now)

and then YES initilize the repo with a README

For everything else, select default.

4. Click "Create repository"

5. Copy the HTTP clone URL to your clipboard via green "Clone or Download" button
